**Executive Constraints and Economic Growth.** Working paper, 2024.
<br/>

Despite extensive research on the relationship between democracy and development, the features of democracy that are particularly important for this outcome are unclear. Here, I unpack the democracy-growth link by examining the economic effects of two forms of executive constraints: horizontal constraints, the power of the parliament to control the executive, and vertical constraints, the capacity of citizens to keep rulers accountable. Using a dynamic panel modeling approach, my results show that horizontal constraints decrease GDP per capita after controlling for the effect of democracy. Even though vertical constraints do not affect growth directly, they are strongly associated with more education and lower infant mortality. This research challenges the conventional wisdom that horizontal constraints on rulers, such as checks and balances, are necessary to stimulate investment and growth.
