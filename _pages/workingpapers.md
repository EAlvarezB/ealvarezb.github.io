Most work in regime effects focuses on whether democracy matters for development. However, although the vast academic production it remains unclear what aspects of regimes are producing such an outcome. This problem arises partly because scholars use unidimensional measures of democracy, neglecting the complex and varied nature of regime evolution. I unpack the democracy-growth link by examining the economic roles and effects of two forms of executive constraints. Horizontal constraints are defined as the powers of the parliament to control the executive, whereas vertical constraints are the capacity of citizens to keep their ruler accountable. Using an unbalanced panel with 174 countries from 1950 to 2022, I found that the presence of horizontal constraints reduces GDP per capita. Even though the presence of both institutions foster growth, vertical constraints appear to be driving such an effect. These patterns remain unsensitive across specifications using within and GMM estimators. This research provides evidence of an empirically relevant interaction between democracy components, in which participatory broad-based inclusive institutions seem to be more relevant for development than liberal and elite inclusive ones.
