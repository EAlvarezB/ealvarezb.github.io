Using panel data of 143 countries from 1950 to 2010, this thesis estimates the effects of executive constraints on economic growth. We characterize two types of constraints. Horizontal constraints are linked to the powers of parliament to control the actions of the executive. Vertical constraints are associated with political accountability in which the executive responds to its constituents or the general electorate. By identifying the economic functions of each constraint, a typology of four institutional configurations is proposed. This typology determines the degree to which a ruler is committed to securing individual rights (horizontal constraints function), and accountable to the sanction of citizens (vertical ones function). Fixed effects and GMM estimates suggest that the exclusive presence of horizontal constraints is associated with a decrease of about 0.21 percent of GDP per capita. Vertical Constraints have no significant effect, but the presence of both institutions is associated with an increase of about 0.18 percent of GDP per capita. The results show an empirically relevant interaction between both institutions.
