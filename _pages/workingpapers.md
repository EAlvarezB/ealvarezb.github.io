Using panel data of 143 countries from 1950 to 2010, this article estimates the effects of executive constraints on economic growth. We construct a non-monolithic definition of executive constraints that allow us to characterize two well-specified types: Horizontal and Vertical. The former institutions are linked to a concept of horizontal accountability where the executive is accountable to the parliament, whereas the latter are associated with vertical accountability where the executive is accountable to the electorate. This approach allows us to create a novel typology of political regimes based on the interaction between these institutions. The typology characterizes four institutional settings that determine the degree to which a ruler is committed to secure rights and/or accountable to citizensâ€™ sanction. Fixed effects and GMM estimates suggest that the exclusive presence of horizontal constraints is associated with a decrease of about 0.21 percent of GDP per capita. Vertical Constraints have no significant effect, but the presence of both institutions is associated with an increase of about 0.18 percent of GDP per capita. The results show an empirically relevant interaction between both constraints.
