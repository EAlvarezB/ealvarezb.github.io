I am a PhD Fellow at the [Department of Comparative Politics](https://www.uib.no/sampol) in the University of Bergen, and part-time Lecturer in Political Science at [Universidad Hemisferios](https://www.uhemisferios.edu.ec/). Previously, I was a scholarship recipient at [FLACSO Ecuador](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/). I also have worked as Research Assistant in several projects related to political economy and democracy studies (mostly empirical).

My research broadly focuses on the intersection between politics and economics. Particularly, I am interested in the interplay between politics and development, Quantitative Research Methods and Political Economy. Whitin my own intellectual production, I have analyzed the empirical linkages between elections and fiscal policy components in LA, the development and consequences of state capacity, the impact of participatory institutions on the provision of public goods, and the relationship between political institutions and economic performance. 

Currently, I analyze how limited government political institutions shape social and development outcomes. To address this question, I focus on the consequences of the presence and the sequence in which the participation and contestation components of democracy (i.e. enfranchisement and parliamentary constraint) were introduced across societies. By characterizing these two forms of political constraints, I plan to develop a novel typology of regimes that determines the degree to which a ruler is committed to securing rights and/or accountable to citizens’ sanctions. This approach would shape light to the study of institutional variations that take place within broader institutional designs such as democracy and dictatorship.
