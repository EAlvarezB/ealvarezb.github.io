I am a Lecturer in Political Science in the Department of Social and Human Sciences at Universidad Hemisferios. Previously, I was a scholarship recipient for the Master's program in Comparative Politics in the Department of Political Studies at Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, FLACSO Ecuador. I also earned a Master's degree in Political Analysis and Institutional Assessment at Universidad de Barcelona. I have worked as Research Assistant in several projects related to political economy and democracy.

My research focuses in the intersection between politics and economics, particularly, in Quantitative Politica Economy, Development Economics and Econometrics. Whitin my own intelectual production, I have analyzed the empirical linkages between elections and fiscal policy components in Latin American countries, the development of state capacities, the impact of participatory institutions on the provision of public goods, the institutional conditions for the durability of democracy, and the relationship between political institutions and economic performance. My master's thesis in Comparative Politics examines the channels through which executive constraints affect economic growth by implementing a novel approach based on institutional variations within these institutions and a new typology of regimes based on how rulers are committed to secure rights and/or accountable to citizens.
