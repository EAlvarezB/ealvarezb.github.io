Previously, I was a scholarship recipient for the Master's program in Comparative Politics in the Department of Political Studies at Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, FLACSO Ecuador. I also earned a Master's degree in Political Analysis and Institutional Assessment at Universidad de Barcelona. I have worked as Research Assistant in several projects related to political economy and democracy.
