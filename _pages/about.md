I am a Lecturer in Political Science in the Department of Social and Human Sciences at [Universidad Hemisferios](https://www.uhemisferios.edu.ec/). Previously, I was a scholarship recipient for the Master's program in Comparative Politics in the Department of Political Studies at [Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, FLACSO Ecuador](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/). I also earned a Master's degree in Political Analysis and Institutional Assessment at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/). I have worked as Research Assistant in several projects related to political economy and democracy studies.

My research focuses broadly on the intersection between politics and economics. Particularly, I am interested in areas regarding Quantitative Political Economy, Development Economics and Econometrics. Whitin my own intellectual production, I have analyzed the empirical linkages between elections and fiscal policy components in Latin American, the development of state capacities, the impact of participatory institutions on the provision of public goods, the institutional conditions for the durability of democracy, and the relationship between political institutions and economic performance. My master's thesis in Comparative Politics examines the channels through which executive constraints affect economic growth by implementing a novel approach based on a typology of political regimes that determine the degree to which a ruler is committed to secure rights and/or accountable to citizensâ€™ sanction.
