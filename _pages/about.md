I am a PhD Candidate at the [Department of Comparative Politics](https://www.uib.no/sampol) in the University of Bergen, and part-time Lecturer in Political Science at [Universidad Hemisferios](https://www.uhemisferios.edu.ec/). Previously, I was a scholarship recipient at [FLACSO Ecuador](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/), and a Master's student at [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/web/ub/). I also have worked as Research Assistant in several projects related to political economy and democracy studies (mostly empirical).

My research broadly focuses on the intersection between politics and economics. I am particularly interested in surveying how institutions emerge across societies, what are the implications of different institutional designs and how their effects are measured. My Ph.D. project analyzes the consequences of the participation and contestation components of democracy (i.e. enfranchisement and parliamentary constraint). By defining these two as forms of political control, I develop a typology of regimes that determines the degree to which a ruler is committed to securing rights or accountable to citizensâ€™ sanctions. Empirically, my research plans to produce unpublished valuable data on key institutional and economic factors dating back to the 18th century. As methods, I use panel data analysis, sequencing analysis, and an IV approach. This combined strategy would not only produce stronger inferences but to provide insights into the use of instruments to explore the impact of political institutions. My research will thus contribute by shedding light on the study of the causal effect of institutional variations that take place within broader designs such as democracy and dictatorship.
