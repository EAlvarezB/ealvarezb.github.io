I am a Lecturer in Political Science at [Universidad Hemisferios](https://www.uhemisferios.edu.ec/). Previously, I was a scholarship recipient for the Master's program in Comparative Politics in the Department of Political Studies at [FLACSO Ecuador](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/). I also earned a Master's degree in Political Analysis and Institutional Assessment at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/). I have worked as Research Assistant in several projects related to political economy and democracy studies (mostly empirical).

My research focuses broadly on the intersection between politics and economics. Particularly, I am interested in academic areas regarding Comparative Political Economy, the interplay between politics and development, and Quantitative Research Methods. Whitin my own intellectual production, I have analyzed the empirical linkages between elections and fiscal policy components in Latin American, the development of state capacities, the impact of participatory institutions on the provision of public goods, the institutional conditions for the durability of democracy, and the relationship between political institutions and economic performance. My master's thesis in Comparative Politics estimates [the effects of executive constraints on economic growth](http://ealvarezb.github.io/files/Executive_Constraints.pdf). By characterizing two types of constraints, I developed a novel typology of political regimes that determines the degree to which a ruler is committed to secure rights and/or accountable to citizensâ€™ sanction. This approach enables to examine the economic consequences of institutional variations that take place within broader regime types such as democracy and dictatorship.
